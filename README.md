TentVents
==========

Tent vents? What does that even mean and how does it have any relation to anything ever? Intent Events...

Okay sure, so it stands for a couple of words, but what does that even mean? Basically, TentVents provides (or WILL provide) a RESTful API for pushing arbitrary intents to Android devices (via an app). This should make it a lot easier for developers (or maybe even non-developers?) to make quick and dirty, but really powerful remote automation for their Android-based devices!
